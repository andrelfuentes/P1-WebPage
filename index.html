                           My name is Andrel Fuentes Torres and I am a third year undergraduate student of Computer Science at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras Campus. I'm also pursuing both minor degrees of the Department of CS, Cybersecurity and Programming.
                           <br/><br/>
                           I learned about computer science through recommendations of school peers and family members. When I tried it, it turns out that it was something I really enjoyed and had a motivation to learn more about. It was something really new to me, I never did something close to programming, computer arquitecture, etc. I think that was what made it so likeable to me. I still have many things to learn and decisions to make regarding studies, but I think I found my calling.

                           I basically still a little less than half of my bachellors degree to complete so I have time to decide what to do with my future studies. Even so I have some idea of what I want to do further up ahead.
                           <br/><br/>
                           I think the topic I liked the most, and the one I'm more likely to persue is Cybersecurity. The topics are very captivating and there is so much variety of work in a single field of computer science. The second most interesting to me was Computer Arquitecture, specifically the physical components of the computer, how they are made and how they work with eachother and the OS to complete the computer. I also have interest in graduate studies. My main goal is to become an expert on whatever I decide to fully persue.

Dávila Meléndez & Xavier Abreu Ricardo, from the Introduction to Computer Cience class on my first year at the University. We were tasked to design a very simple website of the country we were assigned, Spain, with the purpose to further learn and sharpen our HTML and CSS skills and knowledge. They were the least used languages in the class, so at the time it was quite the challenge.

                         The Exploring the History of Lego project was done in my Data Science class. It was done through DataCamp and it was made so that through a sequence of structured tasks, you could explore Lego datasets related to colors, sets, and themes. I analyzed a database that included data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. Overall, in this project I analyzed a dataset on every single Lego block that has ever been built.

It reads a text file with written instructions and page numbers separated by spaces and implements the respective algortinms. For this project, the page replacement algorithms to work with are the FIFO page replacement algorithm, the Optimal page replacement algorithm, and the Working-Set Clock page replacement algorithm.
